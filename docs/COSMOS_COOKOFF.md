​Overview
​Join the Cosmos™ Cookoff, a hands-on physical AI challenge for developers, researchers, and system builders in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and vision AI. Build innovative solutions with Cosmos Reason 2, a leaderboard-topping, open reasoning vision language model that helps AI agents and autonomous systems see, understand, and act in the physical world like humans.

​Why Participate? 

​This is an opportunity to level up your skills with cutting-edge physical AI models, build a project to solve a real-world problem, connect with experts, and learn alongside a community of physical AI enthusiasts. It’s your chance to show the world what’s possible with Cosmos. 

​The Challenge

​Build something great with Cosmos Reason 2—post-train for a specialized reasoning model, a data curation tool, a robot brain that understands a new domain, or a video analytics agent. 

​Get creative with Cosmos Reason. You can use it standalone or mix in other open models to bring your vision to life. 

​Access NVIDIA experts, who will provide guidance, feedback, and technical help through office hours and our Discord channel to ensure you make the most of Cosmos Reason.

​Note: Cosmos Reason is purpose-built for physical AI. This challenge does not cover generative media, art, gaming, or content creation projects. 

​Who Should Participate

​Developers and researchers building robotics, autonomous vehicles, and vision AI pipelines

​Teams (1-4 members)

​Those looking to experiment, evaluate, and benchmark physical AI workflows in a safe, supported environment

​Additional Tools From the Cosmos Cookbook

​Kick off with Cosmos Cookbook recipes, but you can also adapt, extend, or innovate across robotics, autonomy, simulation, transportation, or more. We recommend the following recipes:

​Egocentric Social and Physical Reasoning—Test and evaluate robot-human social and spatial interactions with reasoning.

​Post-Training Cosmos Reason (Intelligent Transportation)—Learn how to post-train Cosmos Reason using a supervised fine-tuning technique with an example transportation dataset to better understand traffic scenarios.

​Physical Plausibility Prediction—Synthetic data generation is a game-changer, but not all of the outputs are usable. This recipe shows how to evaluate the physical plausibility of synthetically generated videos.

​Build a Video Analytics AI Agent—Unlock the power of agentic AI to understand, reason, and act on your live video streams or stored files. Use the NVIDIA Blueprint for video search and summarization, and start getting insights.

​Scoring and Judging Criteria
​Quality of the Ideas* 

​Does this solution demonstrate a compelling application of Cosmos Reason for robotics, autonomous systems, and video analytics AI agents? 

​Technical Implementation

​Is the software development high quality and easy to follow, reproduce, and evaluate? 

​Is there clear documentation of inputs, outputs, and evaluation steps?

​Design

​Is the design of the project and user experience well thought out and intuitive? 

​Impact

​What problem does this solve?

​How does it move the physical AI field forward and/or impact the world?

​Judges

​Your projects will be reviewed by experts from Datature, Hugging Face, Nebius, Nexar, and NVIDIA, bringing deep experience in open models, cloud/compute, and real-world edge and vision AI deployments.

​*Fairness and Reviewer Consistency

​We ensure fairness through a diverse judging committee composed of both internal and external experts from different backgrounds. All judges will receive standardized training and calibration guidelines to promote consistent scoring and reduce individual bias.
